# Database-Driven Web Application
Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a web-based application with a structured database management system (DBMS). The objective is to create a fully functional frontend while integrating it with a MySQL database using PHP for dynamic content management. Additionally, database normalization up to 3NF ensures data consistency and optimal performance.

Key Features

Responsive Web Design: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive user experience.
Database Integration: Connected MySQL with PHP for efficient data storage and retrieval.
SQL Operations: Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data dynamically.
Data Normalization: Structured the database up to Third Normal Form (3NF) to remove redundancy and improve efficiency.
Scalability & Maintainability: Followed best practices for database design and web development.
